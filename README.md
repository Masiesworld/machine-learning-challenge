# machine-learning-challenge

In this exercise, two model are used to do classification. As seen in the first model's notebook (model_1), Data structures are examined and appropriate features are selected. 
* *Note: I did label encoding for the output variable, changing from string to numbers.* 

Comparing the two models, SVM is better in classification than logistic regression. The accuracy rate increased from around 60% to 82%. Within the SVM, it's pretty good out of the box, but after the tuning, the accuracy rate increase from 82% to 84%.
